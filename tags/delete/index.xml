      <description>C++ allows us to create variables at runtime. The variable can be created in Stack memory or Heap memory.
Memory Layout in C++ Stack Memory Functions are allocated stack memory every time they are called by the machine. Whenever a new local variable is declared, more stack memory is allocated to store the variable in that function.
Stacks grow downward when such allocations are made. All local variables of this function become invalid after the function returns, since the stack memory of this function is deallocated.</description>
