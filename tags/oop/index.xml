      <description>Our knowledge of inheritance begins with the fact that we can create derived classes from a base class, which is one of the core features of OOP. A derived class inherits the features of a base class.
Assume that the same function is defined in both the derived class and the based class. When we call this function using the object of the derived class, the derived class&amp;rsquo;s function is executed.</description>

      <description>C++ supports inheritance as a key feature of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It is a method for creating new classes (derived classes) from existing classes (base classes).
Base class and Derived class A derived class inherits the features of a base class as well as its own features.
Each shape has two properties, for example area and perimeter. And child classes should be able to access these properties, so we have given them the protected access specifier.</description>
