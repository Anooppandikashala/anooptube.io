      <description>C++ supports inheritance as a key feature of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It is a method for creating new classes (derived classes) from existing classes (base classes).
Base class and Derived class A derived class inherits the features of a base class as well as its own features.
Each shape has two properties, for example area and perimeter. And child classes should be able to access these properties, so we have given them the protected access specifier.</description>
